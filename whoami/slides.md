# Code

Use code snippets and get the highlighting directly!

```ts {all|2|1-6|9|all}
interface User {
  id: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  role: string;
}

function updateUser(id: number, update: Partial<User>) {
  const user = getUser(id);
  const newUser = { ...user, ...update };
  saveUser(id, newUser);
}
```

---

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly use. And add your custom components are also super easy.

```md
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/custom/#components) for more.
